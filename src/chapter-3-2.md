The first step in selecting the right AI tools and platforms is to identify your specific writing needs. Consider the following questions:

By identifying your writing needs, you can narrow down the list of AI tools and platforms that will be most useful for your writing practice.

Research AI Tools and Platforms

After identifying your writing needs, research the various AI tools and platforms available to address those needs. Here are some things to consider:
